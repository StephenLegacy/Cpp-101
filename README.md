# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles in C++

Welcome to the **Object-Oriented Programming Principles in C++** repository! This repository is a comprehensive collection of examples, explanations, and code snippets demonstrating the core concepts of OOP using the C++ programming language. It is designed to be a practical resource for students, educators, and developers aiming to understand and implement OOP in C++ effectively.

## Introduction

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a fundamental paradigm in software development. It provides a structured and modular approach to writing reusable and maintainable code. This repository focuses on breaking down the core OOP principles in C++ with real-world examples and clear explanations.

## OOP Principles

### 1. Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the bundling of data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, typically a class. It also involves restricting access to certain details to protect the data from unauthorized interference.

- **Example:**  
  ```cpp
  class BankAccount {
  private:
      double balance;
  public:
      BankAccount(double initialBalance) : balance(initialBalance) {}
      void deposit(double amount) { balance += amount; }
      double getBalance() const { return balance; }
  };
  ```

### 2. Abstraction
Abstraction simplifies complex systems by modeling classes appropriate to the application domain while hiding implementation details.

- **Example:**  
  ```cpp
  class Shape {
  public:
      virtual void draw() const = 0; // Pure virtual function
      virtual ~Shape() {}
  };

  class Circle : public Shape {
  public:
      void draw() const override { std::cout << "Drawing Circle" << std::endl; }
  };
  ```

### 3. Inheritance
Inheritance allows a class (child) to inherit the attributes and methods of another class (parent), promoting code reuse.

- **Example:**  
  ```cpp
  class Animal {
  public:
      void eat() { std::cout << "Eating..." << std::endl; }
  };

  class Dog : public Animal {
  public:
      void bark() { std::cout << "Barking..." << std::endl; }
  };
  ```

### 4. Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows the same function to behave differently for different objects. This is commonly achieved through function overriding and virtual functions.

- **Example:**  
  ```cpp
  class Shape {
  public:
      virtual void draw() const { std::cout << "Drawing Shape" << std::endl; }
  };

  class Rectangle : public Shape {
  public:
      void draw() const override { std::cout << "Drawing Rectangle" << std::endl; }
  };
  ```
